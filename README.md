# Round_Robin_CPU_Scheduler
This project is based on round robin alogorithm CPU scheduler made with help of c++.  
You are a computer systems engineer working at a large technology company. Your manager has tasked you with creating a simulation program to test the performance of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. The simulation program should generate a set of "processes" with random arrival times and CPU burst times, and should run the Round Robin algorithm for a set amount of time (e.g. 100 time units). The program should record the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process and should compare the results with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler.  Your manager is interested in the results of the simulation to evaluate how well the Round Robin algorithm would perform in a real-world scenario, and to identify any potential issues that need to be addressed. She has given you one week to complete the simulation and to prepare a report of your findings and conclusions. As a computer systems engineer, you will need to: 
a. Design and implement the simulation program using a programming language of your choice.
b. Generate a set of "processes" with random arrival times and CPU burst times using a random number generator. 
c. Implement the Round Robin scheduling algorithm in the simulation program. 
d. Have the simulation program run for a set amount of time (e.g. 100 time units) and record the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
